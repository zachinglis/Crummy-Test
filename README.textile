h1. Crummy Test

h2. Introduction

I lost the previous test library in a rather frustrating migration fail. I quickly created this to fix this. I went with the archaic route of visual testing for now but I plan on implementing RSpec into it later.

My last Crummy library was private as I tried to work out how to implement decent test into the gem itself but I have given up. There is no good solution in my experience so I am realising this.
